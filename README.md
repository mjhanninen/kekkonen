# Kekkonen #

**Kekkonen** is a very conservative color scheme for Vim. It brings the code
forth and sends the comments and other stuff to the back without looking like a
christmas tree. It is the kind of color scheme you would like to have switched
on when the guys from the news are filming your work.

## Status ##

The current version is 0.1.

The general appearance is there but there are leakages in many modes.

## Installation ##

Copy `kekkonen.vim` into you `~/.vimrc/colors` directory. After that the color
scheme should be available through `:colorscheme kekkonen`.
